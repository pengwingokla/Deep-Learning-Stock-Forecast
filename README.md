# Deep-Learning-Time-Series-Stock-Forecast


## Project Description
This deep learning project aimed at predicting stock prices using historical data of open and close prices. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), the project offers predictive insights for both short-term and medium-term investment strategies.

The model is designed to predict stock prices for two distinct time windows: a single-day window and a seven-day window. By offering predictions for both short and medium-term intervals, the project caters to the diverse needs of investors, from day traders to longer-term investors seeking strategic insights.

## Future Development of the Project

* Interactive UI enhancement to offer an even more interactive and intuitive experience for investors. The interactive UI will feature dynamic visualizations, customizable settings, and real-time updates, empowering users to effortlessly interpret and act upon the generated insights. Through user feedback and iterative design improvements, the project aims to provide a seamless and engaging platform for informed decision-making in stock trading.

* Optimized dataset streaming capabilities to further improve the scalability of the model. By implementing advanced streaming techniques and leveraging parallel processing frameworks, the project aims to enhance the speed and responsiveness of data ingestion and processing and allow the model to handle larger volumes of historical data and adapt dynamically to changing market conditions.

* Include sentiment analysis using NLP techniques to analyze news articles, social media posts, earnings call transcripts, and other textual sources to gauge market sentiment. By extracting sentiment from text data, such as positive or negative sentiment toward a particular stock or the market as a whole, NLP can provide valuable insights into investor sentiment and market trends. Incorporating sentiment analysis into stock prediction models can help improve their accuracy by considering the impact of market sentiment on stock prices.
